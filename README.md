# Danny Riso Thesis Repository
  
### How to run the wiki_demo program:  
    python download.py  
    python wiki_demo.py  
  
download.py downloads the categorylinks and page files for the 10/20/2020 enwiki and enwikibooks wikidumps and formats them into readable files using the WikiUtils repo. These files are all used in wiki_demo.py. First run download.py, then wiki_demo.py. Due to the size of the wiki dumps, this can take upwards of 15 minutes depending on your computer.
